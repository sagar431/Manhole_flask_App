# Project Title

This project uses TensorFlow 2.0 to build a web-based object detection application that can detect whether a manhole is open or closed. The application is built on Flask, a popular Python web framework, and uses pre-trained object detection models to analyze images and identify manholes.The app is designed to be used by anyone who needs to quickly and accurately determine whether a manhole is open or closed. This could include city or municipal workers who need to inspect manholes for safety, utility companies that need to monitor manhole conditions for maintenance, or anyone else who needs to ensure the safety and security of public infrastructure.By leveraging the power of deep learning and object detection, this application can quickly and accurately analyze images and provide real-time feedback on the status of manholes. This can help prevent accidents and ensure the safety of workers and the public. Additionally, by automating this process, it can help save time and resources for organizations that need to monitor large numbers of manholes.

## Installation

1.Clone the repository to your local machine.
 ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/sagar431/Manhole_flask_App.git
```
2.Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.
```bash
cd your project directory
```
3.Create a virtual environment for the project:

```bash
conda create -n envname python==3.8 -y
  
```
4.Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
conda activate envname
```
5.Install the required packages using pip
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
6.Once all the packages are installed, you can run the Flask web app using the following command:
```bash
python clinetApp.py 
```
